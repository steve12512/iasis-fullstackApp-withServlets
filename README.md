This project basically creates a full stack application that runs on the Apache Tomcat compiler.
Java contains the .java files and their .class output.
Jsp contains the servlets.
In order to run the app you would need access to the database, whose number and code have been hidden for obvious reasons.


Using the app the user can register and save his account and then proceed to log in.
He/she can schedule 3 types of medical appointments, and then proceed to search for them, cancel them or read his/hers medical history.
Then an employee of the medical lab that operates on the app can log in with his/hers credentials and provide the user with a response based on the conclusion and evaluation of his medical appointment by the doctor. 
That evaluation is appended on the user's medical info tab.
